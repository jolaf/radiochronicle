The software is created to record the activities on amateur radio channels on LARP, airsoft and other activities using portable radio transmitters or walkie-talkies for communication.

Radio talks may contain information facts important for further activity,
things to be analyzed and funny things to laugh at later, so recording them seems useful.

The software is written by russians, so many auxiliary documentations pages are in russian. They're not critical for the program use and further improvement though.
